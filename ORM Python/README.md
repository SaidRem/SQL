# ORM Python

This directory contains Python scripts and files related to working with databases using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python. ORM allows you to interact with databases using Python objects, making database operations more intuitive and efficient.

## Contents

- **Python Scripts**: Files demonstrating how to use ORM libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Peewee) to perform database operations such as creating tables, inserting data, querying, updating, and deleting records.
- **Examples**: Practical examples of using ORM for common database tasks.
- **Configuration**: Files for setting up database connections and configuring ORM frameworks.

## Libraries Used

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/): A powerful and flexible ORM for Python.
- [Django ORM](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/): The built-in ORM for Django web framework.
- [Peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/): A lightweight and simple ORM for Python.
